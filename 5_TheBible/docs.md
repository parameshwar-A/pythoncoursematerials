# Documentation

Documentation are created to instruct the users to have a idea of what that product or software is capable and how to use it.

One advantage of Documentation compared to books and tutorials are, When you watch tutorial you get a knowledge of what that particular person tried and learnt.

But when we see Documentation it is created by author or author's team so it includes all options and most likely knowledge of the author itself. 

So it is a great idea to read Documentation when you are stuck. 

Here is the [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
