# EB bill amount calculator

## Requirement 
You are creating a web application with lot of tools to help everyday task for people. Part of the application is eb bill calculator. 

Based on the units of power consumed, need to calculate bill amount based on the cost per unit

## Concepts needed
variables, operators(arithmetic, assignment)

## Points to note
- Initialize two variable (one for power consumption in units and another for cost per unit)
- The first 100 units is free so no need to include it in the price calculator
- After the first 100 units, each unit will cost as cost per unit value
- calculate the bill amount, store it in a new variable and print it at the end

## Example
power consumed = 500
cost per unit = 5
bill amount = 400 * 5 (Note the first 100 units will be omitted in bill amount calculation since it is free)
bill amount = 2000

### Happy coding :)
