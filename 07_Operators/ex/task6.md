# Body mass index calculator

## Requirements
Need to create a simple BMI calculator 

## concepts needed
variables, arithmetic and assignment operator

## Points to note
- Initialize two variables (one for height and one for weight)
- Take the below BMI formula and feed the inputs.
- BMI = (Weight in kg)/(Height in m^2) 
- Print the BMI as output finally.


## Example
weight in kg = 55
height in m = 1.55

BMI = 22.9
