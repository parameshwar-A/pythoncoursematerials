# Rotation 

## Requirement
- To rotate the given string for the particular length for given n digits
- to print the rotated string as output

## Steps
- Get the string as user input
- Get the number n for rotating the string
- Rotate the string
- Print the output

## Rotation sample
input string: "welcome"\
n: 3

output string: "comewel"

#### explanation
original: "welcome"

1st rotation: "elcomew" -> w moved from left to right end

2nd rotation: "lcomewe" -> e moved from left to right end

3rd rotation: "comewel" -> l moved from left to rigth end

since the n is given as 3 only 3 rotation is needed!

so output will be "comewel"

## Note:
- len(string) is a function to give the length of the string. 
- use len function and any string actions and methods to solve this problem
