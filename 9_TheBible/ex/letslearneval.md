# Learnign eval function using documentation

- I have shown you guys how to search and look up items in documentation
- Now go checkout some know items like print and input in documentation and re-read them by yourself to understand how documentation is structured

- But the exercise is after you are familiar with those two items looking in documentationsearch for eval command in docs.
- Then try the same function to write a sample code. (Don't use internet for this, just the documentation)

- Name is "eval"
