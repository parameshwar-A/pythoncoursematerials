# Type casting

We may be in a situation to convert one data type to other

We work with multiple data types some times you may need to work with these on that times you may need to convert one from another

Let's say you get age from user where they mentioned 14.5 but all you need is full value so you need only 14 

So here the float --> int

This called type casting. This is not limited to numbers.

You can convert a int --> boolean

How can we do this, it is very simple just call the function of same data type.

let's say you need something to be converted in int so you call int()

int(14.5) --> will give you int as 14

bool(12) --> will give you bool as True

Like this it will give you the converted output.
## Let's see some conversion in action!













PoPossible conversions
- Int --> float
- float --> int (but you will lose decimal data)
- int --> str
- float --> float
- int --> boolean
- float --> boolean
- boolean --> int (but only 0 for False and 1 for True)
- boolean --> float (but only 0.0 for False and 1.0 for True)
- str (only numerical strings like '1') --> int
- str (only numerical strings like '1') --> float
- str (only boolean strings like 'True') --> boolean ssible conversions
