# Bills

- Bills are good example for having different variables and data types. So what we are going to do in this exercise is to convert a physical bill into python variables

- Because we don't like with iterators in real life instead in real life we deal with bills and real time data like that


- I have placed a picture of bill in this folder, your task is to identify what data type each item can be used to use real data inside python

### example
- billNo => String

Like the above example you have to match for entire bill
Have Fun!
