# While learning
- Python interpreter 
- An simple Editor (Mandatory for first 2 weeks)
- In linux, I suggest the below editors but you can use any one from open source community

***

## Graphical editors
	- Xed
	- LeafPad
	- Geany
## Terminal editors
	- Emacs (Offers both graphical and terminal)
	- Vim
	- Nano

*** 
# Once you know something in Python
- Switch from simple editor to IDE (Integrated Development Envirionment)
- Few options are there,
	- Pycharm (Community edition free)
	- Eric python IDE
	- Wing python IDE
	- Pulsar ( a new editor created by Atom devs)
	- Or you can integrate some plugins to existing text editor to make it an IDE

*** 
# Once you are working with client projects you may need Virtual environments (Some IDE has by default)
- don't worry we got you covered in this course and help to learn virtual envs and how to use them 

***

# A repo (Not for python, but for this course purpose)
- Must have a account in GitHub or GitLab or any other repo 
- So the code can be shared without hassle

## Now you know what we need, Shall we start!
