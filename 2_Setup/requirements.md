# While learning
- Python interpreter 
- An simple Editor (Mandatory for first 2 weeks)

# Once you know something in Python
- Switch from simple editor to IDE (Integrated Development Envirionment)

# Once you are working with client projects you may need Virtual environments (Some IDE has by default)

# A repo (Not for python, but for this course purpose)
- Must have a account in GitHub or GitLab or any other repo 
- So the code can be shared without hassle
