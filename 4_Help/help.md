# Help

When you are stuck, where to get help.

Python has inbuilt help option just like one we do for linux commands. So feel free to explore this.

The syntax for opening command inside python script or interpreter is 

`help(<func_name>)`

If you are in bare terminal shell you don't need to open interpreter every time to get help to avoid this we have pydoc

Syntax for pydoc is 
`pydoc <func_name>`

### What to look

In these help, you can get valuable info about parameters and their syntax

Get to know the use of that item

I use mostly to check parameter syntax

### So let's check the help of print command

These are short and crisp amount of information. If you want more detailed and technical one you can refer documentation. 

Which is explained in next chapter!
