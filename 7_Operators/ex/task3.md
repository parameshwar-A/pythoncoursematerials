# Solve the x

# Requirement
Solve the value for x for the below quadratic equations
- x^2+3x-10=0
- x^2-8x+12=0

## concepts needed
variables, operators(arithmetic, assignment) and formula for solving quadratic equation

## Points to note
- X^2-2x+4=0, the co-efficients of x^2 and x are mentioned as a and b. The constant will be mentioned as c
- The equation will be like ax²+bx+c=0
- Formula needed to solve (-b±√(b²-4ac))/(2a)
- For applying square root there are many ways in python. You can use any type. One of the arithmetic operator can be used to find the squareroot value. But you don't need to limit yourself to that method alone. Feel free to use any method.
- Initialize variable a,b and c with values
- Solve the equation for both + and - case scenarios in the formula
- Store both +ve and -ve value in two seperate variables and print them at the end

### Example
x^2+2x-3=0
so 
a=1
b=2
c=-3
Put it in the formula
(-b±√(b²-4ac))/(2a)

The +ve will be 1
the -ve will be -3

### Happy coding :)
