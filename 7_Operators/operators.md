- Some arithmetic operators like + are polymorphic i.e the can be used for non-numerical data types like string.

***

## Logical

- Mostly logic gate operations like (AND, OR, !)

***

## Comparative

- Comparing two or more data values like greater than, lesser than, greater than equal to,...

***

## Assignment
