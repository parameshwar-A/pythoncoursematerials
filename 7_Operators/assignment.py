# Assignement operators are used to assign values to all kinds of variables.

a = 10 # Here value 10 is assigned to variable a
print("Basic assinement: ",a)
# There are lot of ways to assign values to a variables.

# Say we can assign a increment of the value to the same variable
# We can do that!

a += 1 # Short form for a = a+1
print("Increment by 1: ",a)
# Similar case for decrement

a -= 5 # Short form for a = a-5
print("Decrement by 5: ",a)
# This same method goes for multiplication and division too

a *= 10 # Short form for a = a*10
print("Multiply by 10: ", a)

a /= 2 # short form for a = a/2
print("Division by 2: ", a)
