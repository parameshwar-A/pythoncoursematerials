# Data types in python

- Data types are used to store the data in specific format. Computers understand only 0 and 1s but how it knows decimals, integers and other type of Data

- This type of classification is due to these data types. They made it possible

- They help us to store our daily life items in python or in any languages. 

### Let's take a example of a grocery bill!

## So now we know what are we expecting

- Python provides 4 basic data types to work with
They are
* Int
* Float
* Boolean
* String

- Int are short form for integers, Basically numbers without decimal points
- Float are numbers with decimals
- Boolean are states just like 0 and 1 but they are True or False
- String are textual characters they can be of any language and glyphs sometimes too

## Examples
- Int 2,3, 12, 49
- Float 1.34, 34.4445, 83.999
- Boolean True
- String "Hello", "Welcome"

## Python is dynamically typed language

So it means we don't need to specify the data type of the variables before starting using them. Some programming languages like C are stacic typed language they need you to specify the data type.

But you can be free in python with this.

Directly assign a value it will find what type of data is that

when apple_rate=20 --> This will be stored as Int

## Let's see some practical handson
