## All allowed variables are always not the best way to use it
Below are some Conventions followed in general programming

- Be specific, even if it is lenghty(tlc_discourse_user_api_key) 
- Do not name a variable as i, a, b (Avoid one letter variables)
- User camelcase or pascalcase or snakecase (But don't mix them, take one and use it completely in the project)

### camelCase
-The first letter will be small but next word should start with Upper case without any space inbetween
- Example: myName

### PascalCase
- All word starting letter will be upper case without space in between the words
- Example: MyName

### snake_case
- Each and every words will be started with lower case and seperated by _
- Example: my_name
