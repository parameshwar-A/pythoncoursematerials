## Exercise 1
Now you know python is everywhere, where you want to use it or why are you learning this course in python ?

The reason for this question is, if you don't know what you want you won't give your fullest, you may still be wandering off to this.

Also if I know why do you want to learn it, I can create customized projects around it so you will be interested in learning.
