# Variables

Variables are storage items which can be identified with a name.

Let's think of an IceCream shop
We have lot of flavoured icecreams in identical containers.
But how the shop owner identifies a particular flavour. 
* The reason is each conatiner is labeled with the name of flavour *

Similarly while programming we cannot get all inputs from user everytime, we can store what we get and store what we already have in the program itself.

So python knows where it needs to take!

But we cannot name a variable of anything, to make it stable we have some rules to follow while name it
