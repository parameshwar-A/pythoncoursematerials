# For Loops
# used when exact number of iteration is determined the start and stop
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# for num in numbers:
   # print(num) 
# print("hello")

# for num in range(0, 101,5):
    # print(num)


# #print("parameshwar"[::20])
# #print(list(range(1,11)))

# name_list=["nihaal","dhana", "paramesh", "ayaanar", "guhan"]

# for name in name_list:
   # print(name)
#
#for index in range(0, len(name_list)):
#    print(name_list[index])
#
# "abcdef"
# ord("a")
# chr(97)
for letter in range(97,123):
   lower=chr(letter)
   print(lower)
#
# Let's take a deep look

# range(0, 10) --> will give iteratable numbers of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
# Important Note: Just like slicing ending won't be included. (n-1) will be the final item

# num variable is a iteration variable which takes values for every completion of loop.
# For first run it will have 0, in second run it will have 1, so on...

# The range function also has a step value just like string slicing syntax

#range(start, stop, step) Default step size is 1
#for num in range(0,10,2):
#    print(num)

# for letter in "paramesh":
	# print(letter)
