# While Loops
# These are used when you know what exact condition you need to stop but don't know how many iterations you need.
# Or we can rephrase when we need to continue is known 
# data = input("Enter your name: ")
# while data:
	# print(data)
	# data = input("Enter your name: ")
	

a += 1
a = a+1

count=0
while count<1000:
   count+=int(input("Enter amount: "))
print("The final count is: ", count)

# While needs three important items otherwise he won't be friendly

# Initialization
# Condition 
# Incrementation

# You can also use know iterations problems to while too. 

# num=0 
# while num<=10:
    # print(num)
    # num+=3
